  // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port
  // The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) suggests the range 49152 to 65535  for dynamic or private ports.
  // Many Linux kernels use the port range 32768 to 61000.

  // From http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/port-mapping-isolator/
  // Mesos provides two ranges of ports to containers:
  //
  // • OS allocated “ephemeral” ports are assigned by the OS in a range specified for each container by Mesos.
  // • Mesos allocated “non-ephemeral” ports are acquired by a framework using the same Mesos resource offer mechanism
  //   used for cpu, memory etc. for allocation to executors/tasks as required.
  //
  // Additionally, the host itself will require ephemeral ports for network communication. You need to configure these
  // three non-overlapping port ranges on the host.

  // We reserve 1000 ephemeral ports for Marathon/Zk/Mesos Master/Mesos Agent processes to listen on:
  val EPHEMERAL_PORT_START = 32768
  val EPHEMERAL_PORT_MAX = EPHEMERAL_PORT_START + 1000
  // and use the rest of the range as ports resources for mesos agents to offer e.g. --resources="ports:[10000-110000]"
  // IMPORTANT: These two ranges should NOT overlap with each other and with the operating system's ephemeral port range
  // define in ci/set_port_range.sh!
  val PORT_RANGE_START = EPHEMERAL_PORT_MAX + 1
  val PORT_RANGE_MAX = 60000 // 60001 - 61000 is reserved for port 0 random allocation. See ci/set_port_range.sh.

  // We use 2 different atomic counters: one for ephemeral ports and one for port ranges.
  private val ephemeralPorts: AtomicInteger = new AtomicInteger(EPHEMERAL_PORT_START)
  private val rangePorts: AtomicInteger = new AtomicInteger(PORT_RANGE_START)

  // Make sure the same ephemeral port is not given out twice making port collisions less likely. We're iterating
  // over ephemeral port range trying to open a socket and if successful return the port number. Should we ever run
  // out of free ephemeral ports a RuntimeException is thrown.
