# Core Models

The `core-models` module defines the data types used in the unified scheduler interface. They are shared between the
core, orchestration and persistence layer.

The API is documented [here](https://mesosphere.github.io/usi/api/com/mesosphere/usi/core/models/index.html) under
`com.mesosphere.usi.core.models`.
