# Dummy Framework

Run a dummy framework that:
 - uses only the raw mesos-client
 - successfully subscribes to Mesos master
 - declines all offers since its well, pretty dummy
 
Not much, but shows the basic idea. Good to test against local Mesos. Note that we neither suggest, nor support, using the mesos-client on its own without the other components within this repository.
