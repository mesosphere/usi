  /**
    * Abstractions in this class were designed with below interests:
    * 1. Use the slf4j abstraction without any backend (such as logback etc.,). Consumers of this library should be
    *    free to chose whatever backend they wish to use. `MDC` is a well-known concept in java world and many logging
    *    backends will be able to do a structured logging that includes MDC.
    * 2. Make it easy to compose context(s) E.g.: [[Traversable]] of tuples of type ([[String]], [[Any]]) for loggers.
    * 3. User should be able to :
    *     - Mix in one of the [[ImplicitStrictLogging]] or [[ImplicitLazyLogging]] traits
    *     - Use the logger instance `logger` to print log statements with some context parameters.
    *     - Pass the context to another method or class which has no information about context built so far
    *       and thus can chose to built context further on top of the current context OR start fresh.
    *
    * Following snippet shows an example of how the [[LoggerTakingImplicit]] can be used with the
    * abstractions defined here :
    *
    * {{{
    *    // import all the implicit defined here in to scope.
    *    import com.mesosphere._
    *
    *    // Mixin one of the traits.
    *    class MyClass with ImplicitStrictLogging {....
    *
    *    // Make a log statement with no (empty) context.
    *    logger.info("hello world!") // Note that this uses the implicit empty context.
    *
    *    // Make a log statement with some context.
    *    logger.info("hello world!")(LoggingArgs("key1", "value1"))
    *
    *    // Make a log statement with more context.
    *    val moreContext = LoggingArgs("key1" -> "value1").and("key2" -> "value2").and("key3" -> "value3")
    *    log.info("hello world!")(moreContext.and("key3" -> "key4"))
    *
    *    // The above statement will log through whatever backend slf4j was tied to statically.
    *    // All the key value parameters in context are populated in MDC just before the log statement is made and are
    *    // deleted immediately after. This happens every time the `logger` object is used to generate a log statement.
    * }}}
