/**
  * Container class responsible for keeping track of the state and cache.
  *
  * ## SpecificationState vs SchedulerLogic state
  *
  * The SchedulerLogic has two pieces of state: SpecificationState and SchedulerState (records and statuses). The
  * SchedulerLogic maintains the latter. All manipulation to the SchedulerLogic state is done via one of the two
  * processes:
  *
  * - The specification state is updated through incoming SpecEvents (we consume and replicate the
  * framework-implementation's specifications)
  * - The SchedulerState (statuses, records, etc.) is updated through StateEvents that returned as intents
  *
  * As such, it's worth emphasizing that business logic does not have any direct side-effects, and it manipulates the
  * SchedulerState only by returning intents. This allows us the following:
  *
  * - It's more efficient, since it saves us the trouble of diffing a large data-structure with each update
  * - We have built-in guarantees that evolutions to the SchedulerState can be reliably replicated by processing these
  * events, since they led to the changes in the first place
  * - We can easily know which portions of the SchedulerState should be persisted during the persistence layer.
  * - It restricts, via the type system, the portions of the state the business logic is allowed (IE: it
  * would be illegal for the business logic to update a specification)
  *
  * ## Intents and Events
  *
  * In the SchedulerLogic code, we'll use the word intents and events. Intents are things not yet applied, and should
  * be. Events are things that were applied and we're notifying you about.
  *
  * In the SchedulerLogic, a StateEvent is used both to manipulate the SchedulerState (similar to how event-sourced
  * persistent actors evolve their state), and is also used to describe the evolution (so that the state can be
  * incrementally persisted and followed). In the SchedulerLogic, we'll refer to a StateEvent as an intent until it is
  * applied, after-which it will be called an event. Mesos calls will be referred to as intents as they are not applied
  * until they are published to the Mesos Master.
  *
  * ## Concept of a "Frame"
  *
  * Visualized:
  *
  * [Incoming Event: offer match]
  *      |
  *      v
  * (beginning of frame)
  *   apply pod launch logic:
  *     create an intent for Mesos accept offer call for matched pending launch pods
  *     specify the existence of a podRecord, with the launch time and agentId
  *   update internal cache
  *   process revive / suppress need
  * (end of frame)
  *      |
  *      v
  * [Emit all state events and Mesos call intents]
  *
  * In the SchedulerLogic, each event is processed (either a Specification updated event, or a Mesos event) in what we
  * call a "frame". During the processing of a single event (such as an offer), the SchedulerLogic will be updated
  * through the application of several functions. The result of that event will lead to the emission of several
  * stateEvents and Mesos intents, which will be accumulated and emitted via a data structure we call the FrameResult.
