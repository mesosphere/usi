[Design principles behind USI](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon-design/blob/master/unified-scheduler/index.md)

How to run:

```
$ gradle :hello-world:run
```


How to test:

```
$ gradle test
```

## Versioning

### Semantic versioning and compatibility guarantees

USI uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). That means 
we are committed to keep our documented API compatible across releases 
unless we change the MAJOR version (the first number in the version tuple).

For example version 1.1.0 and 2.0.0 will not have a compatible API, but 
1.2.0 and 1.1.0 should be backwards compatible. 

Please take note that API below version 1.0.0 aren't considered stable and may
change at any time.

### Automatic patch versioning

USI's patch version is automatically generated by counting the number of commits on master since some indicated point-in-time. Each time a commit is merged in to master, the version is automatically incremented. This version is generated by the script `./version`.

When a branch is created, a snapshot version is created which takes the base version from which it diverged, followed by the 7-character commit rev. IE: `0.1.18-292eeb4-SNAPSHOT`.

## Documentation

### Written documentation

USI documentation is included in the docs folder

### Generated graph

A visual of the scheduler graph can be found in `docs/scheduler-stream.svg`. This graph is updated, manually, by the project `docs/scheduler-vis`. See the [docs/scheduler-vis/README.md](docs/scheduler-vis/README.md) for more info.
