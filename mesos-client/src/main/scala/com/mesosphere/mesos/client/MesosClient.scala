    * the Mesos Master is lost. Any pending messages in flight (in the stream, or transmitting over TCP) before this
    * connection is lost are dropped. Usually, when this happens, the `mesosSource` will also drop, although you should
    * not always depend on this. It is the recommendation that if either the `mesosSink` or the `mesosSource` streams
    * terminate, for any reason, that the entire MesosClient is terminated.

    * +------------+

    * | Connection |

    * | RecordIO   | (3)
    * | Scanner    |
    * +------------+
    * |
    * v
    * +--------------+
    * | Event        | (4)
    * | Deserializer |
    * +--------------+
    * |
    * v
    * +------------+
    * | Subscribed | (5)
    * | Consumer   |
    * +------------+
    * v
    * +---------------+
    * | MesosClient   |
    * | (with events) | (6)
    * +---------------+
    *
    * 1. Http Connection: mesos-v1-client uses the Akka-http low-level `Http.outgoingConnection()` to `POST` a
    *    [SUBSCRIBE](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/scheduler-http-api/#subscribe-1) request to Mesos
    *    `api/v1/scheduler` endpoint, providing framework info as requested. The HTTP response is a stream in RecordIO
    *    format which is handled by the later stages.
    *
    *    If we connect to a non-leader Mesos master, we automatically follow the redirect up to `conf.maxRedirects`.
    *
    *    When we receive the HTTP response headers from the master connection, we set aside the `Mesos-Stream-Id`(see
    *    the description of the
    *    [SUBSCRIBE](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/scheduler-http-api/#subscribe-1) call) for later use
    *    in mesosClient.mesosSink. Schedulers are expected to make HTTP requests to the leading master. If requests are
    *    made to a non-leading master a `HTTP 307 Temporary Redirect` will be received with the `Location` header
    *    pointing to the leading master.
    *
    * 2. HTTP Response Bytes: The Akka HTTP response includes an Akka Stream for reading the HTTP response data. We
    *    flatten this stream of bytes into this stream such that down-stream components get blocks of ByteStrings.
    *
    * 3. RecordIO Scanner: Each stream message is encoded in RecordIO format, which essentially prepends to a single
    *    record (either JSON or serialized protobuf) its length in bytes: `[<length>\n<json string|protobuf
    *    bytes>]`. More about the format
    *    [here](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/scheduler-http-api/#recordio-response-format-1). RecordIO
    *    Scanner uses `RecordIOFraming.Scanner` from the [alpakka-library](https://github.com/akka/alpakka) to parse the
    *    extracted bytes into a complete message frame.
    *
    * 4. Event Deserializer: Currently mesos-v1-client only supports protobuf encoded events/calls. Event deserializer
    *    uses [scalapb](https://scalapb.github.io/) library to parse the extracted RecordIO frame from the previous
    *    stage into a mesos
    *    [Event](https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/master/include/mesos/scheduler/scheduler.proto#L36)
    *
    * 5. Subscribed Handler: Consume a single `SUBSCRIBED` event, and instiates the MesosClient
    *
    * 6. MesosClient: Contains the subscribe information, connection information, etc. The events at this point are
    *    available via the materializable-once source, `.mesosSource`, which DOES NOT include the earlier-consumed
    *    SUBSCRIBED event.
